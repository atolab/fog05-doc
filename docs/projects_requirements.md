- Support unified authentication across different RATs
- Support of multiple, simultaneous connection from UEs via differents RATs
- Support SDN/NFV
- Support UEs mobility and service continuity
- Support low latency applications (from operators and third-part application) by hosting them close to access network
- Support network slicing
- Support network sharing
- Support service chaining
- Support integration with central clouds
- Support network assisted D2D and V2X
- Support the federation of different computing and networking infrastructures
- Provides API to access EFS for 3th-part applications
- Provides an unified virtualized execution environment
- Provides a discovery system for Fog CDs
- Support the mobility of Fog CDs
- Support the run of VNF from RAN, C-RAN, TN,CN
- Support MANO for Edge DCs, Fog CDs (optimal instantiation and life cycle management)

## 5GCity Requirements

Based on the proposal document, the requirements for 5GCity are:
