# Eclipse fog05's lightweight deployment

Eclipse fog05 is designed to be deployed from big servers to micro-controllers.

## Decentralized state

Eclipse fog05 uses Eclipse Zenoh for location-transparency state access and management. Thus, it can be deployed on resource constrained devices and leverage other nodes for state management.

## Modular

Eclipse fog05 is built with a plugin architecture and his components can be deployed separately.
