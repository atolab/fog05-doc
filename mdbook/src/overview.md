# What is Eclipse fog05?

Eclipse fog05 allows the end-to-end management of compute, storage, networking and I/O fabric in the Edge and Fog Environment. Instead of relying on a centralized architecture (like cloud-management-systems) it is based on a decentralized architecture.

Eclipse fog05 allows users to manage and deploy different types of applications, packaged as: containers, VMs, binaries and so on. This is achieved through the Eclipse fog05's plugin architecture.

More specifically, Eclipse fog05 is a Fog Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution composed by two major components:

- The Fog Orchestration Engine (FOrcE)
- The Fog Infrastructure Manager (FIM)

These components provides the abstractions needed to deploy your applications in the Fog and Edge environment.
